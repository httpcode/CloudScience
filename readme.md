Cloud Science is our companies web site. It uses nodejs, socket.io, easeljs to show a ninja for each live visitor to the site.
Each user can use the arrow keys and move the ninja around the screen.

Thanks to http://www.36peas.com/blog/2010/9/13/free-japanese-ninja-shinobi-sprite-sheet.html for the Ninja sprites.

Also the animation code was heavily inspired by David Rousset (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2011/07/21/html5-gaming-animating-sprites-in-canvas-with-easeljs.aspx)
